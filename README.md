# Data Science for job hunting
In my current job hunting in Data Science, I found the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ZbzTryBZY from the channel "Self made millennial", about job search, interviews... There, Madeline Mann described a "high intensity" strategy for job searching.
The main goal of this strategy is to make as many personal interactions with colleagues as possible, in order to get advice about the role, position and industry, and focus in some companies as target, looking for interactions with employees of those companies, in a more or less random way, to get information about the "target" department, the managers or supervisors of that department, and get information about possible roles or opportunities.
