# Data Science for job hunting in Data Science
In my current job hunting in Data Science, I found the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5ZbzTryBZY from the channel "Self-made millennial", about job searching, interviews... There, Madeline Mann described a "high intensity" strategy for job searching.

The main goal of this strategy is to make as many personal interactions with colleagues as possible, in order to get advice about the role, position, and industry, and focus on some companies as a target, looking for interactions with employees of those companies, in a more or less random way, to get information about the "target" department, the managers or supervisors of that department, and get information about possible roles or opportunities.

In my opinion, this process can be seen just as a problem of information processing, so I think that can be really interesting to design a global "Data Science" project around all this search for a job process. I would like to document all the process and share the different scripts and tools used, and I think that all could be easily adapted to other industries or work areas.

Three main areas or paths will be design and developed at the same time:

- General interactions and advice
- Work market analysis and seld-candidacy
- "Classical" job applications analysis
